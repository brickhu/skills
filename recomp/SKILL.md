  Replicate a UI component from a component library documentation page into a
  headless (behavior-only, unstyled) component for the user's framework
  (SolidJS / Vue / Svelte). Use when the user provides a component library docs
  URL (shadcn/ui, Radix, MUI, Ant Design, ...) and wants that component ported
  to their stack as paste-ready source code — e.g. "按照文档复刻组件",
  "照着文档生成 headless 组件", "把这个组件移植到我的框架",
  "replicate/port/convert this component from <url>". Everything is delivered
  in the conversation (source files, usage notes, style contract); nothing is
  written to the user's project.

# recomp — component docs → headless replicator

Replicates a component from a library documentation URL into a **headless**
(behavior-only, zero styles) component in the user's framework, delivered in
conversation for the user to copy into their own component directory. The user
owns styling, design tokens, and integration.

## Input

| Input | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Docs URL | yes | single-component docs page of a component library |
| Project root | no | enables read-only probing of framework/CSS/tokens; falls back to cwd; if nothing detectable, ask one line |

## Workflow

1. **Fetch & validate the URL** — must be a single-component docs page
   (component name + props/API table + usage examples). Not a component library
   → refuse with a reason. Unreachable page → propose npm / GitHub source.
   → `references/verification.md`
2. **Probe project context (read-only)** — framework+version, CSS approach,
   design tokens (DESIGN.md, `:root` vars, `@theme`, stylex tokens), existing
   conventions, and whether an ecosystem headless library is present
   (Kobalte / Reka UI / Bits UI — used as reference material). Ask the user
   only on ambiguity or blind spots, with detected results pre-filled.
   → `references/probing.md`
3. **Build the behavior contract** — extract interface (props/events/slots,
   controlled/uncontrolled) and behavior from docs. Anything the docs do NOT
   state explicitly becomes an **open question** with a proposed approach
   (APG standard / ecosystem reference implementation) — never implemented
   silently.
4. **Confirm the contract (gate — mandatory)** — present the behavior
   contract summary, then walk through the open questions **one by one**
   (each: proposed approach, reply 1 采纳建议 / 2 自己定义). Confirming the
   last question ends the gate — generate the deliverables directly
   afterwards, with no extra confirmation round. The contract summary and open
   questions live ONLY in this gate — never embed them in the final delivery.
   → `references/deliverables.md`
5. **Generate deliverables** — in conversation only; complete files, never
   patches; framework-native idioms (Vue `v-model`, Svelte 5 `bind:`/runes,
   Solid signals). Open with "✅ 组件已复刻成功…".
   → `references/deliverables.md`
6. **Iterate** — user copies (accept) or requests changes; always re-emit full files.

## Deliverables (after the user confirms the contract)

User-priority order — source first, keep the delivery lean:

1. **Opening line**: "✅ 组件已复刻成功，复制以下组件代码到你的项目目录即可使用。"
2. **Source code** (top priority) — complete files, one code block per file
   with filenames, dependency list with versions
3. **Usage** — minimal working example + API summary
4. **Interface standard** — props/events/slots/types, plus the style interface
   contract (data-attributes, class slots, CSS variables) for the probed CSS
   approach
5. Optional, at the very end — acceptance script (keyboard, focus, ARIA snapshot)

The behavior contract summary (validation + open questions) is presented
BEFORE replication as the confirmation gate; do not repeat it in the delivery.

## Hard rules

- **Read-only**: never create directories or modify files in the user's
  project; probe results are session-only judgment input, not persisted
- **Never guess accessibility semantics** (ARIA roles, focus management,
  keyboard behavior): they become open questions with a proposed approach
  (APG standard / ecosystem reference) for the user to confirm — never
  invented, never implemented silently
- **Refuse** non-component-library pages (with a reason). If the user's
  ecosystem already has an equivalent headless implementation
  (Kobalte / Reka UI / Bits UI), **learn from it as a reference** (behavior +
  API), but still deliver the replicated code — never redirect the user to
  install a third-party library
- **License**: replicate interface + behavior only, never copy proprietary
  source or style values; record source URL + fetch date in the decision log
- Complex components (DataGrid, virtualized tables, date pickers): state
  quality expectations up front or recommend a mature library
